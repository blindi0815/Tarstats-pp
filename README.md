# Tarstats-pp
Tool to provide stats of a tarball.

## Info
This is a little command line tool to provide statistics on a GNU tar file. It is a personal project to further self study programming using C++.

The project is inspired by https://github.com/isotopp/tarstats by @github/isotopp and the Twitter thread https://twitter.com/isotopp/status/1489549907841146882

## Goal
Goal is to provide stats like total amount of files/ directories and printing them out to stdout, a plain text file and JSON. Support for GNU zip compressed files will come too.
